A volumetric multi-material modeling language and compiler developed by the [Matter Assembly Computation Lab](https://www.matterassembly.org/) at the University of Colorado Boulder. OpenVCAD is an automatable volumetric design framework that can fully leverage multi-material fabrication. OpenVCAD provides a scriptable suite of constructive solid geometry and functional design methods that enable the representation of complex objects with hundreds of materials. OpenVCAD allows for full spatial control over the material composition of an object. Additionally, it provides functional grading and convolutional blending techniques to generate parts with dynamic mechanical characteristics. This research tool is intended to be used for the design and development of new meta-materials, digital allows, and compliant mechanisms.

# Documention

## Gallery & Benchmarking
![Render of benchmarking objects (a though d)](documentation/benchmarking_composite.png)

a. shows a mesh node that is graded with two materials

b. shows a screwdriver that consists of a mesh node and graded with three materials

c. shows a soft actuator that consists of a functional geometry node and graded with three materials

d. shows a mug that is designed using multiple functional geometry nodes and boolean operations

# Download
## Pre-compiled OpenVCAD binaries
Pre-compiled binaries of the OpenVCAD compiler can be found in [releases](https://github.com/MacCurdyLab/OpenVCAD/releases). These include two versions:
1. IDE-like program with UI and OpenGL-based rendering preview
2. Standalone command-line application that compiles `.VCAD` scripts into PNG stacks, [OpenVDB](https://www.openvdb.org/) grids, or binary voxel files.
