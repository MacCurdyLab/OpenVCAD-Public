OpenVCAD is an open-source volumetric geometry compiler for the design and fabrication of **functionally graded, multi-material** objects.  
It brings advanced **implicit modeling** and **programmable parametric design** into the world of additive manufacturing, enabling designers to create objects with continuous material gradients, lattice structures, and simulation-informed material distributions.

With OpenVCAD, you can:

- Express geometry **and** multi-material composition using **implicit functions**.
- Create complex gradients and digital alloys using **functional material nodes**.
- Design **algorithmically** in Python using `pyvcad` — integrate with NumPy, SciPy, optimization, or simulation workflows.
- Compile directly for **inkjet, FFF, and other AM processes**, with export to slicing and simulation-ready formats.
- Work in a GUI-based IDE — **OpenVCAD Studio** — for code editing, preview, and export.

## Gallery

Here are a few examples of what OpenVCAD can produce:

### Functionally graded lattice
![Example 1 – Functionally graded lattice](images/lattice_example.png)  
*Multi-material graded lattice structure made with soft, rigid, and non-curing liquid.*

###  Multi-material Stanford Bunny

Strut color is a function of strut length. The bunny is comprised of 3,289 unique struts.*

## How OpenVCAD Works

1. **Modeling** – Use the `pyvcad` Python package to create a hierarchical tree of geometry + material nodes.
2. **Compilation** – Run an OpenVCAD compiler module to convert the model into volumetric data.
3. **Export** – Output formats include PNG stacks for inkjet printing, FEA meshes for simulation, and meshes for FFF printing.

Key capabilities:

- **Material transitions** – Gradual changes in material properties within one object.
- **Fully implicit representation** – Geometry *and* material are expressed implicitly, scaling to hundreds of billions of voxels.
- **Digital alloying** – Combine materials at a fine scale for intricate compositions.
- **Blending** – Convolution-based smoothing across complex material interfaces.
- **Image-based processing** – Drive material distributions from images (e.g., medical scans).

## What OpenVCAD **Is Not**

OpenVCAD is **not** a voxel-by-voxel design tool. While it can emit voxel data, design is done implicitly with high-level math expressions that scale to extremely large builds (e.g. Inkjet 3D printing).
