OpenVCAD is an open-source volumetric geometry compiler for the design and fabrication of **functionally graded, multi-material** objects.  
It brings advanced **implicit modeling** and **programmable parametric design** into the world of additive manufacturing, enabling designers to create objects with continuous material gradients, lattice structures, and simulation-informed material distributions.

With OpenVCAD, you can:

- Express geometry **and** multi-material composition using **implicit functions**.
- Create complex gradients and digital alloys using **functional material nodes**.
- Design **algorithmically** in Python using `pyvcad` â€” integrate with NumPy, SciPy, optimization, or simulation workflows.
- Compile directly for **inkjet, FFF, and other AM processes**, with export to slicing and simulation-ready formats.
- Work in a GUI-based IDE â€” **OpenVCAD Studio** â€” for code editing, preview, and export.

## ðŸ–¼ Gallery

Here are a few examples of what OpenVCAD can produce:

### Functionally graded lattice

*Multi-material graded lattice structure made with soft, rigid, and non-curing liquid.*

###  Multi-material Stanford Bunny

Strut color is a function of strut length. The bunny is comprised of 3,289 unique struts.*

## How OpenVCAD Works

1. **Modeling** â€“ Use the `pyvcad` Python package to create a hierarchical tree of geometry + material nodes.
2. **Compilation** â€“ Run an OpenVCAD compiler module to convert the model into volumetric data.
3. **Export** â€“ Output formats include PNG stacks for inkjet printing, FEA meshes for simulation, and meshes for FFF printing.

Key capabilities:

- **Material transitions** â€“ Gradual changes in material properties within one object.
- **Fully implicit representation** â€“ Geometry *and* material are expressed implicitly, scaling to hundreds of billions of voxels.
- **Digital alloying** â€“ Combine materials at a fine scale for intricate compositions.
- **Blending** â€“ Convolution-based smoothing across complex material interfaces.
- **Image-based processing** â€“ Drive material distributions from images (e.g., medical scans).

## What OpenVCAD **Is Not**

OpenVCAD is **not** a voxel-by-voxel design tool. While it can emit voxel data, design is done implicitly with high-level math expressions that scale to extremely large builds (e.g. Inkjet 3D printing).

## ðŸ›  Installation
OpenVCAD can be used in two main ways:

### 1. **OpenVCAD Studio** (GUI IDE)
> [Read our install guide](https://github.com/MacCurdyLab/OpenVCAD-Public/wiki/Installing-OpenVCAD-Studio)
- A standalone IDE for creating, previewing, and exporting designs with `pyvcad`.
- Ships with `pyvcad` built-in â€” no separate Python install needed.
- Available for **Windows** and **macOS (Apple Silicon)**.
- Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/MacCurdyLab/OpenVCAD-Public/releases).

### 2. **pyvcad** (Python library)
> For advanced users
- Python bindings to the OpenVCAD C++ kernel.
- Installable via PyPI:
  ```bash
  pip install OpenVCAD
  ```
- Best for algorithmic workflows, integration with simulation, or headless rendering.
- Runs on Windows and macOS.
